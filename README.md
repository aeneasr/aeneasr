I author and maintain popular open source projects which are primarily written in Go or React. I care deeply about education, climate change, data privacy and ownership.

I have co-founded Serlo Education e.V. in 2009, a German non-profit NGO which operates the open education platform www.serlo.org and brings educational resources (math, physics, chemistry, German, ...) without advertising and free of charge to millions of users per month.

In 2014 I founded the [ORY open source organization](https://github.com/ory) which provides popular developer tools in the area of user/identity management, access control, policy management, user privacy, delegation and federation, cloud automation, and cloud security.

Since 2019 I work full-time at Ory as a founder and CTO. Projects I am most proud of are pinned below. There are many other projects I contribute to which you may find in my public commit history.

My master thesis in computer science [*Distributed linear correlation cluster detection using MapReduce*](./rek18-lmu.pdf) applies mathematic projections and computer graphic algorithms to high-volume and high-dimensional data in order to find meaningful patterns in reasonable time.
